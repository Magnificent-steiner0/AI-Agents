            "Ohm's Law is one of the fundamental principles in electrical engineering and physics, first formulated by German physicist Georg Ohm in 1827. This law describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit, stating that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it and inversely proportional to its resistance. This relationship is mathematically expressed as V = IR.\n",
            "\n",
            "The verification of Ohm's Law is crucial for understanding basic electrical circuits and serves as a cornerstone for more complex electrical analyses. In this experiment, we aim to demonstrate and verify this fundamental relationship by measuring the current flowing through a resistor at various applied voltages. By plotting these measurements on a graph, we expect to observe a linear relationship between voltage and current, with the slope representing the reciprocal of the resistance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Understanding and verifying Ohm's Law is essential for various practical applications, from designing simple electronic devices to analyzing complex electrical systems. This experiment not only helps in comprehending the behavior of electrical components but also provides hands-on experience with basic electrical measurement techniques and data analysis.\n",
